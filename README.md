# Comedy vs Drama Movie IMDB scores
Using a data set collected from imdb movie statistics, I looked at the relationship between two genres of movies and the imdb rating received. I focused on the genre comedy and drama to determine if there is a significant difference in rating. If certain genres are statistically higher in rating, focusing on that genre of movies could help a company's branding as well as lead to further investigation in profit and budgets. 
The raw data was gathered from kaggle with 7668 entries and 15 variables
